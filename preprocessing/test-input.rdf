<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albedo> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Albedo, or reflection coefficient, is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a dimensionless fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface. Albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation."@en .
